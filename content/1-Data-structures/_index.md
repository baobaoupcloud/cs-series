***Data structures*** essentially are forms of organization in memory. There are many ways to organize data in memory.
Abstract data structures are those that we can conceptually imagine. When learning about computer science, itâ€™s often useful to begin with these conceptual data structures. Learning these will make it easier later to understand how to implement more concrete data structures.
